    {
	just now able to write but i'vebeen at the studying since yesterday.
	i'm researching and taking notes on functionalities and how those compare to what i learned for C.
	"python does it for you" seems like a very apt description for the language itself.
	
	i spent yesterday taking notes about string basics and methods used with strings, as well as learning about
	the arithmetic and comparison operators.
	
	i was up early doing laundry so once i got home and cleaned up a little bit i started on lists, tuples and sets.
	i plan on making my way through all the basics stuff and syntax of it all just to get a better handle on the
	language, and also plan on gaining a better understanding of OOP in general from those studies.
	
	back to it.
