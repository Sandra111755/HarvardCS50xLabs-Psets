i've been working my way through the week 4 lecture for the passed 2 days.

i'm planning on having it finished by the end of today, and some work put into the lab at the very least.
there is so much information needing to be processed and notes to be taken from such a densely filled video.

i've found that switching to a hybrid style of study works best for me.
i process, absorb and take notes on the cs50x lectures but i'm also solving random problems on
codewars/leetcode to keep my coding skills sharp and to get a better understanding of data structures and algorithms.

i believe that spreading out my learning in such a manner will help me grow much faster and
retain more information than just trying to get through the material as fast as possible.

As much as i crave learning and advancing myself i am doing my best to not burn myself out by overdoing it.

it's a marathon not a sprint.

i finished the week 4 lecture; the 15 pages of notes is definately a record for two and a half hours worth of lecture.
i learned quite a bit about pointers, scanf, malloc and free; i was also introduced to valgrind, which is a program that analyzes
code in programs for possible memory issues.
i'm looking forward to starting the lab and then moving on to this weeks problem sets, so much so that i may (re: very likely will)
put in time over the weekend so i can at least start the problem sets on monday.

    i just finished setting up the rest of the structure of the files for the volume lab after enjoying nice dinner.
    the structure includes a journal, objectives, and psuedocode.
    i've gone over what is being asked for the lab and i believe i'll be able to figure it out.
    as much as i'd like to continue right now, i'm going to rest for the day and absorb both what i learned today
    and my delicious dinner.
