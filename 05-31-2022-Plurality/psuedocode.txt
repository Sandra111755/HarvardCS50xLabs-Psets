Objectives distilled:

-------------------------------------
1. Complete the vote function.
    a. If name matches one of the names of the candidates in the election, then update that candidate’s vote total
    to account for the new vote.
    b. The vote function in this case should return true to indicate a successful ballot.

    c. If name does not match the name of any of the candidates in the election, no vote totals should change, and
    the vote function should return false to indicate an invalid ballot.

    ** You may assume that no two candidates will have the same name.

2. Complete the print_winner function.
    a. The function should print out the name of the candidate who received the most votes
    in the election, and then print a newline.

    b. It is possible that the election could end in a tie if multiple candidates each have
    the maximum number of votes. In that case, you should output the names of each of
    the winning candidates, each on a separate line.

psuedocode for plurality.c
------------------------------------

bool vote(string name)

1.  if vote name matches candidate name
        candidate vote +1
        return true
    else
    return false
    print invalid vote

void printwinner(void)

2.  count max votes
    if candidate votes = max votes
    print candidate name


----------------------------------------------

Program should behave as follows:

$ ./plurality Alice Bob
Number of voters: 3
Vote: Alice
Vote: Bob
Vote: Alice
Alice

$ ./plurality Alice Bob
Number of voters: 3
Vote: Alice
Vote: Charlie
Invalid vote.
Vote: Alice
Alice

$ ./plurality Alice Bob Charlie
Number of voters: 5
Vote: Alice
Vote: Charlie
Vote: Bob
Vote: Bob
Vote: Alice
Alice
Bob
