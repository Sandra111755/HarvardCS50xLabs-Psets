{
    i'm starting filter-less. it looks quite complicated at first glance.
    i'm going to get myself orgnanized then dig into it, ideally with little issue.
}

14:09:00 - monday - 06/13/2022
{
    i am getting better at filtering information i think. that is to say that i don't *have* to understand 1000% of
    every bit of "finished" code that is presented to me to complete a function or two for it. just understand what is being
    passed to those functions and process the data accordingly.

    i was feeling a bit overwhelmed when i started the day, looking at the entirety of the weeks problem sets,
    but i feel a bit better now having realized that.

{
    finishing today while having finished the volume lab, grayscale and sepia filters for filter-less.
    if i can clean up the sepia conditionals tomorrow i will, but it's "readable" and it works as intended.
    will be tackling reflect and hopefully blur tomorrow
}

8:05:00 - tuesday - 2022/06/14
{
    thinking on it and putting some research into it i don't believe i could clean up the sepia filters,
    not without introducing either an additional function, more complex nested statements
    or an equally simple but wholly unnescessary switch statement.

    i'm trying a different arguably better long term date formatting. instead of day month year it will be year-month-day, to aid in
    organization and make searching much easier.

{
    after spending the majority of the day trying different ideas for reflect i landed on one that showed promise and
    it ended up being the solution that the problem was looking for. thankfully
    keeping things short and to the point while still remaining readable is an ideal to strive for.

    blur looks like it will be an interesting problem to solve.
}

16:29:00 - tuesday - 2022/06/14
{
    going over all pertinent information, blur is going to be *very* difficult to solve but still feels like it's
    not nearly as bad as tideman. i suppose i'll see, haha.

    it's been a long day so i'm going to rest for today. i'll do my best to work out blur starting tomorrow morning.
}

08:06:00 - wednesday - 2022/06/15
{
    feeling a bit aprehensive about blur, but still going to push on.
}

11:33:00 - wednesday - 2022/06/15
{
    worked through blur slowly and methodically, breaking down bigger problems into smaller problems and what seemed to be
    quite a difficult problem to solve wasn't so bad in the end?

    learned today about the continue; function, which is basically the opposite of break; and proved very useful in
    the problem solving process.

    all that isn't to say i didn't have errors when compiling that i had to route out.

    there were a few variables who weren't collecting and saving values as they should have, which i'm guessing
    to be an error in scope with regards to the for loops that were using the variables.

    excited to move on to getting recover set up!
