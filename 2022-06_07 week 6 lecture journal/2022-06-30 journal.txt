    {
	a bit of a late start today.
	i am currently in the midst of (some of?) those consequences i wrote about yesterday. 
	these next couple weeks are going to be emotionally and mentally difficult on a variety of levels.
	i however still need to seriously keep at the coding thing regardless of how i'm feeling.

    {
	still not 100%. decided to stop a bit early cause i'm feeling mentally exhausted.
	i did manage to follow and absorb over an hours worth of the lecture. the similarities and 
	differences between python and C are extremely interesting, i.e what python handles automatically 
	compared to what you have to define yourself in C. 
	E.g strings in python are immutable, meaning you are unable to modify them without making a copy first
	then modifying that copy. whereas in C you are free to change and move and copy as you see fit.

	i think i'm going to go outside, set up my target and get some exercise throwing knives.

	i'll continue on my journey tomorrow.
