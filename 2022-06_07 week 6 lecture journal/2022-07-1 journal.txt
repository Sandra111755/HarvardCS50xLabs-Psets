    {
	i hope to be able to finish the lecture today. 
	writing all pertinent information down certainly makes getting through them take longer, 
	but it's also true that there have been studies that show that writing down information by hand helps 
	increase the retention rate by quite a lot.

    {
	i took a break about halfway through my day to install our air conditioners, and to make dinner.
	that took about an hour and after that i got right back to the lecture.
	i managed to finish the lecture today and got through some of the "shorts" video on python, which is 39 minutes 
	and explains a lot of the syntax and structures comparing C to python directly with a code by code comparison.
	i find examples like that help my understanding of the syntax and how things are used quite a bit.

	i'm gonna stop for the day as i'm still not feeling well mentally or emotionally, but i'm also proud of
 	how much i accomplished today. 
	
	until next time.
