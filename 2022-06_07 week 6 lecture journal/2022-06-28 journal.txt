	i just got back from picking my car up, it cost me $825 to fix quite a few mechanical issues with the car, but even with that 
	i'm afraid it's only just the tip of the iceberg since the car is a 2005 and has 172,000 odd miles on it.
	i'm hoping beyond hope that if and when i can bring it back in that the majority of the other issues can be dealt with 
	appropriately. 
	as an aside i'm glad to have it back and happy that it's driving smoother.

	i managed to make it 18 minutes and 20 seconds into the week 6 lecture and just finished the syntax comparison 
	between Scratch, C and Python. 
	it is *very* satisfying to see how python is structured and how the syntax is organized and written.
	i expect there will be minor issues with syntax (mostly not rememebering to remove the semi-colon, and not remembering to 
	add the colon) while coding in python but that remains to be seen.

	as for the rest of today, i'm going to relax and start fresh tomorrow morning.
