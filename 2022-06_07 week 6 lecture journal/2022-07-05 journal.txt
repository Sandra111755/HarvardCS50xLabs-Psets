	today's gonna be a bit lacking as far as progress made goes, i've been asked to run an errand around 9am and
	will have to pick up my partner around 4 ish.
	regardless, i expect to finish the rest of the shorts video and make some progress into problem set 6.
	i'm looking forward to starting to program with python.
	as much as i like the ordered syntactical nature of C, the complex-simplicity of python and how it's written
	very much appeal to me at this point in my journey.
	it remains to be seen if that will be the case once i am writing with it.
	i'm also looking forward to what css, html and javascript have to offer and am excited to see what i'll be 
	able to produce with those languages.

	as an aside, my weekend was really blah mood-wise.
	i did end up making an eggplant parmesan calzone (with spaghetti inside), which was fun to eat.
	i don't expect i'll make it again however, simply because the added spaghetti didn't really add much to
	it beyond a little bit of flavor that was mostly overpowered by the eggplant and cheese.
	it was interesting for what it was though, and came out looking fantastic.

    {
	just finished up with the shorts video, there was a suprising amount packed into a relatively short video 
	that was only 39 minutes-ish long.
	
	i'm going to jump into the problem sets to get a feel for python, so i have a better handle on the lab itself.
