    {
	decided to check in real quick.
	i am now using an awesome hi-polymer squishy reuseable eraser for my notes after having run out of the eraser on the 
	mechanical pencil i've been using. there was a backup for the pencil that i was unaware of, but the hi-polymer one will
	definitely see more use.

	i need a mental health day to recoup. i had to make a very tough decision last night regarding a relationship i'm in, in spite
	of the possible consequences to that relationship.

	i'm planning on watching a movie or two, and possibly throw some knives (at a wooden end-grain target(homemade)).
	i've found that the latter can be very meditative even with the planes roaring overhead every few minutes.

	until tomorrow.
