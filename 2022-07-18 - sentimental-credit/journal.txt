        have my objectives and specifications all set. i will be digging into sentimental-credit heavily tomorrow, both
        before and after my dental appointment (need a filling). i hope it goes well.
        i'm going to be taking a train into the city for it, and that's always an enjoyable experience outside of rush hour hahaha.

        until tomorrow.

        just got back in from my dental appointment and am happy to report that my broken tooth has been fixed.
        i'm currently studying up on regular expressions and their use in credit.py and am expecting myself to successfully impliment
        the re module and it's methods to help in solving the problem before me.

        i could of course simply just do the math as i did in credit.c, but i believe it will be more beneficial for me in the long run
        to learn about and apply what i have learned about regular expressions.

        i have some notebooks coming today and i expect to fill them with knowledge about python, sql, css, js and html.

        it's exciting to know that the juggling beanbags that i ordered have shipped. whether it helps me in my journey of
        coding or not remains to be seen, but at the very least it will be a fun skill that i can practice in the house.

        as the anesthetic for my teeth have worn off i have found i'm more unable to focus because of the pain
        and dull persistent ache of getting them worked on.
        i've watched a few videos on the re module and it is fascinating in how it operates, and it also makes me realize how little i know
        about python itself. yes it's true i have gone over syntactical basics compared to C in the previously watched lecture, but
        i'm feeling kind of similar to how i felt when i first started C.
        in other words i feel like i'm being expected to build a house before i even know what tools i have available to me, and what
        building standards to follow. the remedy for such a thing being that i'm very likely going to take a pause from cs50 and
        study up more on python and all that it has to offer (officially anyways) before coming back to it.

        back from studying up a bit! just finishing up for the day. I have a preliminary idea of how i'd like credit.py to operate
        but will see.
        i'm going to study a bit more tomorrow when i have the chance and put more work into finishing credit.py, but i have
        an appointment to get glasses at 9:30am in the city that i definitely don't want to miss.
        i found out that my juggling beanbags were shipped today from canada, they should arrive on the 19th. fingers crossed!

        i'm gonna pack up for the day and relax a bit before getting some sleep. until tomorrow!

        trying to get my car fixed unsuccessfully. the mechanic has been very busy lately and been down the help he needs. i'm hoping to
        be able to get it in to be looked at and or fixed sometime this week.

        as an aside, i've not been well lately. i'm working my way through a serious breakup with someone that means quite a lot to me.
        i haven't been able to gather the focus nescessary to put more effort into the problem sets i've been working on the passed few days.
        i'm going to work at them more today and moving forward because i must, and because i feel i am able to put forth
        the mental energy required at the current time.
        i will miss what we shared...

        just finished credit.py.
        i tried my best to retain full modularity between the functions i created while also including the use of regular expressions.
        i was having a real hard time with the regular expressions not returning when they matched a certain pattern but
        through the process of trial and error i managed to figure out a method to get the code working as it should.
        thankfully...

        i submitted it and am going to get setup for readability.py before making dinner.
