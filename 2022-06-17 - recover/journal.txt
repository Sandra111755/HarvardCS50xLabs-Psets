        just starting recover.
        a cursory glance tells me i'm going to enjoy delving into solving it,
        i'm going to get started on my objectives then a bit of psuedocode
    }

    {
        after having gone over the objectives, recover seems to be complex in it simplicity, which can be quite deceiving.
        i look forward to putting time into solving it.

    {
        after having gone through all of the literature and the brief walkthrough video on recover on the cs50x website,
        i have a much better idea of what to do and what is expected.

        i will be organizing my notes/psuedocode starting tomorrow. i want to take the time to digest what i've
        written with filter-less/blur and with all the information i've read about recover, my mental strength levels
        are feeling heavily drained at the moment so i believe resting here is appropriate.

        i realize a bit late that i forgot to write at the start of my day.
        i've taken to writing stuff out on paper for recover as i did with tideman. i'm approaching it in such a way that
        i'm trying to plan out a bit before just diving right into the coding. i am trying my best to apply what i'm reading
        about and listening to, about clean code and readability. it is quite relative, though in most cases it's clear
        what is and isn't clean code.
        at any rate, i'm currently in the middle of deciphering how " .h" and extra " .c" files work within the context of recover.
        back to it.
    }

    {
        i'm having a bit of a hard time wrapping my head around all things pointer related,
        even having gone over materials from several locations online about them.
        i'm guessing that much like most other things programming related, i just have to keep at it and it'll click eventually.

    {
        so after a very long day, a LOT of trial and error, deletion of a lot of excessive text in the code,
        and a mix up in logic that was leading to quite a bit of frustration i managed to finish recover!

        i learned a lot. mostly about how just because you can make things like structs that it's not always
        the best choice.
        it was a lot harder to read than just scaling the entire thing back like i did by the end.

        i'm having issues with scope as it regards to variable storage,
        but am able to identify those issues pretty quickly when something pops up.
        hard to imagine but perhaps a bit more planning before action is required?
        will see how the next weeks problem set goes once i get there.

        i'm going to give my brain a rest for today and clean up the code and my psuedocode a bit tomorrow.

        also. i learned that if you're going to write low level psuedocode, you should include brackets
        so that you don't screw them up later trying to figure out what is going wrong hahaha.

    {
        couldn't resist finishing organzing the .c file for recover. i'll finish the psuedocode txt file tomorrow.
        i'm really enjoying this.
    }

    {
        just finished up reorganizing recover stuff(s) and once i submit it i'm on to week 5.
        it's kind of intimidating knowing that i've still only scratched the surface of learning
        how to code and how things all fit together as far as programming goes.
        i'm excited to see where i will end up going down this road...
