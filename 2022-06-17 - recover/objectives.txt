-------------------------------------------------
main objective:

    * Implement a program called recover that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image.


        Your program should accept exactly one command-line argument, the name of a forensic image from which to recover JPEGs.

        If your program is not executed with exactly one command-line argument,
        it should remind the user of correct usage, and main should return 1.

        If the forensic image cannot be opened for reading, your program should inform the user as much, and main should return 1.

        The files you generate should each be named ###.jpg, where ### is a three-digit decimal number,
        starting with 000 for the first image and counting up.

        Your program, if it uses malloc, must not leak any memory.

-------------------------------------------------
usage:

    Your program should behave per the examples below.

    ./recover
    Usage: ./recover IMAGE

    where IMAGE is the name of the forensic image. E.g:

    ./recover card.raw
