original psuedocode that was trimmed down and rearranged in the working version.

if you download the folder and run the program on card.raw, it will extract all the jpg files from it.

main

    if argc != 2

//open .raw(input) file
    FILE *inpointer = fopen(argv[1], "r");
    if inpointer == null

    return 1

    //loop until eof
        BLOCKSIZE buffer;
        while (fread(&buffer, sizeof(buffer), inpointer) == sizeof(buffer))

            //initialize variable to store and read inpointer header

            JPGFILEHEADER jpg;
            fread(&jpg, sizeof(JPGFILEHEADER), 1, inpointer));

            if ( jpg.jpgFirst == 0xff && jpg.jpgSecond == 0xd8 && jpg.jpgThird == 0xff &&
                (jpg.jpgFourth & 0xf0) == 0xe0 )

                //allocate memory for file name
                //sprintf to name the files incrementally by 1
                    FILENAME fname;
                    sprintf(fname, "%03i.jpg", 1);

                //open output file
                    FILE *outpointer = fopen(fname, "w");

    fclose(inpointer);
