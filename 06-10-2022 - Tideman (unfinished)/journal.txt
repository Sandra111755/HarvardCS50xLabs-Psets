    { day 1. friday - 06/03/2022

        i just finished the runoff problem set and i'm planning on enjoying my weekend.
        i got a few preliminary things out of the way. it seems like tideman is going to be pretty tough to solve. }

    { day 2. 08:08:00 - monday - 06/06/2022

        i looked over the problem set over the weekend and i'm planning on mapping out
        the flow of the given program again once i have my objectives.txt file established.
        i believe it helped me previously and will help me again this time around.
        i'm not fond of how long the last one took, but now that i have a better understanding of how the simplemind app operates
        i'm expecting this process to go much faster this time through.
        as an aside, i have looked up code-to-flow style apps/websites but they are cost-prohibitive to me at the moment and
        i want to remain focused on the task at hand.

           15:18:00 - monday - 06/06/2022

        i finished the flowchart in roughly 5 hours worth of work, the rest of the day was filled with running errands.
        i'm excited that i managed to cut off 11 hours from the creation of the flowchart, which is arguably more complex than runoff.
        it helped a lot to have the legend i made previously to keep track of each function at the macro and micro scale respectively.
        i'm planning on having the program i've been given completely understood by the end of tomorrow, but the usage of
        arrays and local variables is different from runoff (or appears to be) so it may not be that easy... we'll see. }

    { day 3. 08:05:00 - tuesday - 06/07/2022

        the flowchart definately helped in my understanding the program better, but not nearly as much as it did with runoff.
        i'm having quite a difficult time in understanding how each of the arrays interact with each other.
        i can forsee myself spending a lot of time attempting to solve this and unsure if i'll be able to without assistance.
        it may be more economical timewise for me to move on and come back later? will see...

    { day 4. 08:33:00 - wednesday - 06/08/2022

        i decided last night after some heavy consideration to shelve tideman for the time being,
        until i'm better able to grasp the interactions between multiple different kinds of arrays. }
