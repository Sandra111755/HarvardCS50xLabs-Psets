        just finished getting set up for readability.py.
        i'm hoping it will be as straightforward as it was completing it previously. i'm also wondering if the application of regex
        to the problem would be as beneficial as it was with credit.py.

        i will likely try to impliment it, but for now i'm going to go make dinner.

        i took some time out today to clean and reorganize the kitchen as it was a bit cluttered, dusty and the floor was filthy.
        sitting down in an air conditioned room as i am now feels amazing after putting forth such an effort in cleaning up the place.
        i also got ready some stuff that needed baking; oatmeal (cranberry)craisin cookies, banana bread and am going to attempt a type of
        scone tomorrow.
        i spent all the time today doing that and still my mind was knee deep in readability.py

        off to it.

        just finished readability.py.
        regular expressions are such a boon; to be able to search through text like it can is pretty incredible. i feel as if i've only
        scratched the surface with them too! i'm going to submit readability.py and get set up for the next problem in the set.
