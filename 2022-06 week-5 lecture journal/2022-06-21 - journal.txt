    just got settled in. i made some stock for chicken ramen after getting home from my dental appointment.
    i'm going to continue the week 5 lecture. i only made it 26 minutes into it over the weekend but it was something.
    i'm gonna take a bigger bite out of it today.

{
    just reached the mid-point of the lecture; the first 25 minutes was one page of notes, the next 40 minutes was three and a half.
    i am expecting to finish the rest of the lecture before having to start a new notebook but only time will tell. thankfully i have an
    extra that will work great as a secondary.
    in an ideal world i will have the first set of five weeks as one notebook and the second half as the last last of five weeks.
    love that kinda symmetry.

    i'm off for the day. expecting to finish the second half of the lecture tomorrow but i could end up typing up to 10+ pages of notes
    for the remaining hour and 2 minutes if it is anything like week 4's notes.
    either way it'll get done sooner rather than later :D
