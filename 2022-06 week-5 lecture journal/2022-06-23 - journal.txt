	starting a bit early today as i have an eye exam and a telehealth appointment that i have to attend.
	i can see, read, and drive just fine but that's just my opinion, i'm not a doctor haha.
	keeping on top of things like vision is important and at the very worst i end up getting glasses? 
	that's not really a big deal for me... 
	at least i'd get to pick out some nice frames :D

    {
	just finished the rest of the shorts, they were quite informative as far as delving a bit deeper into the concepts
	of singly-linked lists, doubly-linked lists, hash tables and tries.
	i'm going to set up for the lab and put some work into it.
