        after having started the day bright and early at 8am, i just finished the lecture. today was spent mostly learning about binary
        search trees, hash tables/functions and also included finishing up linked lists and a section on trie(s) (pronounced try)
	it was interesting seeing all different sorts of data structures and learning their positives and negatives.

        i'm going to take a short break before starting on the shorts videos, cause every little bit of focused knowledge helps and 
        at the very least a refresher isn't a bad thing.

        just finished up in the kitchen. i decided to have dinner early and cleaned up a bit as well.
	back to it.

    {
	finished for the day.
	i managed to make it through the rest of the lecture and all but two of the shorts. i look forward to tackling the last
	videos tomorrow and diving head first into the lab and problem set.
	for now though i'm going to rest.
