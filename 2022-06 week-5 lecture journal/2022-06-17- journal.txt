    i started fresh and early today, a little before 8 ish and got everything with regards to recover organized.
    after submitting it and checking my grade i noticed i had a 96! so i went back and checked the style and a few 
    things were indented that shouldn't have been, so i fixed those and resubmitted it.
    after that i snapped a few pictures of my notes to include in my github and uploaded all the stuff for recover as well.

i had an appointment to attend so i didn't want to get right into week 5 stuff. i'm currently expecting a phone call to set up
another appointment as well.

{
    i'm not feeling very well today, so i'm going to lay down and rest up a bit.
    it's friday and a long weekend; in an ideal world i would get started again on tuesday, but i will probably end up
    working my way through the lecture at some point over the long weekend.
    i have a goal and i'm doing my best to achieve that goal in a timeframe on the smaller end, but also remaining
    cognizant of when i actually need to step back and rest up a bit just so i can continue pushing forward.
