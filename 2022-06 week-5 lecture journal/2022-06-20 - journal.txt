    {
	i woke up early today to handle an errand. i also had to move my study materials including my laptop into the other room because the 
	table was full of painting supplies. i'm going to start a bit of the week 5 lecture on data structures today, but will have other
	errands later that need to be addressed so i will have to pause the studying for a bit.
	i'm going to jump right back into it after my dental appointment tomorrow.

    {
	i managed to get through the first 26 minutes of the lecture with only one page of notes, i expect that will change the further into the video i go. 
	in the middle of going over the lecture i got hungry and decided to make dinner for me and my partner. 
	i have to stop for the day cause they are going to be dying my hair and it usually takes around 3 hours. 
	i'm going to be going into the city tomorrow for a dental appointment quite early, and will start again once i get home.
